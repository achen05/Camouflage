          <span class="tabSpace">This website is the interface for an interactive art experience which examines value and perception.
          I conceived, designed, and developed this project in 2020 as a response to Stephen Hendee's project prompt "Camoflouge" for MICA Forum 1.
          <br>

            I designed this interactive art experience to help users define and materialize their relationships with
              objects, entities, places, and times they find personally significant.
            As you explore this website, I implore you to reflect on
            the ways context informs, and perhaps even singlehandedly creates, our individual experiences
            of beauty and our perceptions of art objects.
