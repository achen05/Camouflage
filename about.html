          I conceived, designed, and developed this project in late 2020 as a response to Stephen Hendee's project prompt "Camouflage" for MICA Forum 1.

            <span class="tabSpace">It has recently come to my attention that I have not yet truly reflected on my process for my latest project, of which I’m not sure what to call. I currently write this in an attempt to not only record my process in making this project, but also as a way for me to understand it myself.
	<br><span class="tabSpace">To understand the concept of my project, I need to draw a parallel with a condition I’m currently working through, as it has come to my realization that this condition is the largest root of my motivation to create this project. This condition, which my therapist and I call super-magical thinking, is a common symptom of OCD, more specifically a subset some experts call ‘metaphysical contamination OCD’, in which I obsess over inanimate objects, times, and places I associate with some particular past traumatic event, as if the traumatic event ‘contaminated’ them, in fear that these ‘contaminated’ things will somehow reignite these traumatic events. To some extent, most people do this, a simple example would be buying and selling houses, if we are aware that a brutal murder had taken place in a house we were considering living in, our relationship with the house changes. Our brain naturally creates associations between things, but for the most part, only the important associations are remembered, the rest simply fade away. My experiences with ‘metaphysical contamination’ for lack of better wording, is a neurotic obsession with these relationships, treating all of them as equally important and applied to everything in my life, from the clothes I wear, my favorite restaurants, and even specific times on the clock. Everything naturally has history, and I could not accept having things in my life with a ‘contaminated’ history.
	<br><span class="tabSpace">For the most part, my relationships with things in my life changed negatively. I actively began avoiding ‘contaminated’ things in my life, I would ‘clean’ things I associated with traumatic events by disposing and/or replacing them, and for things that I associated with fond memories, I would actively avoid as well in order to prevent them from getting ‘contaminated’. I spent hours a day performing ritualistic ‘cleanings’ of objects and hundreds of dollars replacing perfectly functional and beloved objects, including many phones, furniture items, clothes, etc.. I avoided certain places, even places I greatly enjoyed visiting. I stopped listening to certain music, eating certain foods, and the list goes on. I was obsessed with keeping everything free of associations with traumatic events as to avoid the anxiety I felt towards said things. Obviously, the decrease in my anxiety was only temporary as by doing this, I would ultimately reinforce this irrational, maybe even superstitious notion and doom myself to yet again repeating this process again and again.
	<br><span class="tabSpace">After repeating this process of ‘cleaning’ many times over to no success, I searched for a new method to decrease my anxiety towards ‘contaminated’ objects, and began practicing a process I’ll call ‘positive contamination’. This process involved taking a ‘contaminated’ thing and keeping constant interaction with it, as if to re-associate it with a moment of strength, a moment when I was able to look past the negative associations of the thing I was interacting with and accept it regardless. In some way, I romanticized the object, finding beauty in my acceptance of the thing regardless of its contaminated state as a way to cope with the anxiety of this condition.
	<br><span class="tabSpace">My project is, or at least I hope it is, an experience materialized as and by a collection of various media: an interaction with tangible things in reality, a program that takes an input and produces an output, an interface to interact with said program, and lastly, computer-generated images. The experience takes form in the process of making, beginning when the user takes an image of something they find personally significant (an interaction with tangible things in reality), uploads it to this website (the program), and obtains a newly computer-generated image that re-renders the user uploaded image as incoherent static. The experience revolves around, or at least pretends to revolve around, sentimentality. It hopes to inspire a closer examination of the often unseen and/or insignificant relationships we have with the things around us by concealing these things entirely, separating the ‘thing’ and the relationship with said ‘thing’ and therefore isolating the context that makes them meaningful to us.
	<br><span class="tabSpace">Recently, I’ve come to dislike this project for reasons I have not entirely realized. I question its effectiveness: does it truly inspire the user to examine their relationships with things around them? I question what it is: can I sincerely call this a piece of art? A tool? A piece of amateur code? A coping mechanism? Or perhaps it’s something else entirely. I question its value: does this project communicate something that is worth considering, or is it a pseudo-intellectual answer to an obscure question of which has no practical application? And finally, I question its purpose: is this project really about the processing and materialization of sentimentality or is it an elaborate attempt to justify my neurotic fear of metaphysical contamination as something real, important and worth avoiding, which in turn ultimately reinforces this irrational, anxiety ridden mindset? I’ve considered all these questions in the duration of developing this project and unsurprisingly to my disappointment, to no avail.
	<br><span class="tabSpace">However, I do know that for the time being my project is, at the very least, a weak call for empathy; A desperate attempt to share the essence of my experiences battling the condition I currently face by using the experience of sentimentality as a metaphor. It this way, the lack of definition in my project becomes a feature, a truly honest representation of my confusion currently as I navigate my circumstances in real time. For now perhaps that’s all my project needs to be, arguably all it can be and in all honesty, all I currently want it to be.
