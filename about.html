          <span class="tabSpace">This website is an interactive art experience exploring value and perception in artwork.
          I conceived, designed, and developed this project in 2020 as a response to Stephen Hendee's project prompt "Camouflage" for MICA Forum 1.
          <br>
          <span class="tabSpace">As you explore this website, consider the following questions: <br>
          What is beauty/art? <br>
          How is beauty experienced? Is it seen? Felt? Or some other way? <br>
          How is the value of an art object determined? <br>
          Can something be considered art even if only a single individual considers it so? <br>
