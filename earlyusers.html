        If you're reading this, thank you for participating in my project! Please be aware that
        this interface is NOT designed to be used on mobile devices.
        All the essential functions of this website should be working, but because the project
        is still being developed, there may be some missing features and some visual design problems. If there is something broken,
        please contant me as soon as possible.
        Once you enter the site, click the 'START' button or use the text links to begin.
        When you've finished, please send me (via iMessage/SMS) your newly generated image,
        your first name, and the city you currently reside in. Your generated image, first name, and city will be part of the gallery. While it's not required, I encourage you to use the resulting generated image
        for something in whatever way you'd like and sharing it with me.<br> Some examples include: <br>
        Printing it and keeping it as decoration on the back of your phone case (like I have)<br>
        Using it to create a digital collage<br>
        Burning it and taking a photo of the result<br>
        However you choose to experience this project,
        I hope you enjoy my interactive artwork, thanks again for participating.
